          Librarian was based on FBC search service, a Polish website
          established in 2007, whose primary objective is to collect, process
          and make available online information on the collections of Polish
          scientific and cultural institutions.
        </p>
        Librarian gives you answers on most questions about FBC and digital
        libraries coopperating with FBC. You can ask about: what is FBC, how to
        search and navigate through FBC services, also about digital libraries,
        broken links, digital assets licenses, and more.

        Chatbot can be easily used for better experience of using digital
        libraries pages.
