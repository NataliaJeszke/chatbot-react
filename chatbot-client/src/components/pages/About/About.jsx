      <h4>Usage of the Librarian</h4>
      <p>
        Librarian is a chatbot that can be added to your digital library as a
        friendly adviser that helps users to get to know more about your digital
        assets, licenses, broken links issues, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Librarian was created by a librarian who helped users of libraries and
        digital libraries through many years with problems such as: search
        issues, broken links or licenses and rights to digital resources.
        Chatbot was trained on years of experience of exchange topics between
        librarians and readers.
